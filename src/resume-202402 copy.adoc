Software architect, mentor, and author with 20 years of hands-on experience.

### Abilities

Org-wide initiatives:: Leverage my in-depth knowledge of **Typescript**, UI frameworks (**Angular** and **React**), **Node**, and **Nx** to bootstrap new projects with industry-leading best practices and lead teams through delivery
+
* Nx monorepos for Scaled Agile apps with Angular; SiriusXM with Angular with a java back-end; Synapse wireless to support the Angular and node apps using AWS firehose, lambdas, S3, and CloudFront; Github actions, graphQL, and Firebase
* **Mobile HTML apps** for mobile technicians for elevator company for communicating with dispatch as well as their immediate tasks and diagnostics
* Search and Support section of Rogers.com which featured enriched results and a **new architecture for the UI and API with headless CMS**
* Monorepo for a marketing company to create campaigns that had 2-3 day spikes in traffic; node and mongoDB with backbone (this shows its age!). This reduced the time for campaign creation to a week or two compared to weeks and months.

Communication::
* Communicating with executives, development leads, and developers to find solutions when bringing code-bases together into a **monorepo** at SiriusXM, Scaled Agile, American Airlines, DataSite, and many others. It requires a great deal of care and a good amount of understanding of pain points to find good solutions.
* Effectively communicating architecture solutions and **proofs of concept**, drafting **organization-wide documentation**, and writing effective documents (and a **published book on monorepos**).

Transforming the developer experience:: Cut down on time spent on waiting, repetitive tasks, dependency management, standards, inter-team dependencies, and many more inefficiencies
+
* **Reduced build times from 40mins+ to 10 mins or less** at SiriusXM, Synapse Wireless
* Reduced unit test times and increased code coverage to 80%+ with well-written tests and **coaching on writing good tests** at T-Mobile, SiriusXM, Rangle
* Crafted and maintained code generation templates for scaffolding common tasks at SiriusXM, Synapse Wireless, Scaled Agile, DataSite and more organizations, **reducing the bootstrap time to seconds for new features**
* **Transformed entire organization and organization unit code-bases into monorepos** to leverage the advantages: shared types, simultaneous deployments, enabling massive refactors, and to foster collaborative engineering practices. SiriusXM, Synapse Wireless, DataSite, American Airlines, and others

Tackling hard problems:: Latent race conditions, large refactors, upgrades, observability (o11y), performance optimizations
+
* Resolving hard-to-debug race conditions for Synapse Wireless (to do with CQRS and multiple databases), document status propagation over websockets and message queues for DataSite, state management issues over graphql and within application state for DataSite and Synapse Wireless
* **Large refactors of company-wide code-bases into a monorepo**: Synapse Wireless, DataSite, SiriusXM, Scaled Agile, and many others
* **Observability (o11y) implementations** with log maturity (ElasticSearch-based and otherwise), tracking unhandled exceptions, implementing correlationIds and transactionIds throughout
* Surfacing bugs and errors as early as possible through enforcing **strict typing**, writing **better unit tests**, writing **e2e tests with BDD**, and enforcing strict contracts between UI and back-end systems with **Swagger** (now **OpenAPI**)

Coaching and mentorship:: Level up developers and teams by sharing insights and knowledge and; and foster the sharing of knowledge within teams
+
* **Coached leads and teams** on Angular for SiriusXM, DataSite, Synapse Wireless, American Airlines
* **Mentored direct reports** and engineers for Nrwl and Rangle - both with a high bar for engineering ability
* **Implemented the hiring process for Nrwl**, questions and challenges for T-Mobile
