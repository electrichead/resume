## Nitin Vericherla

image::blank.png[,5,5]

I've worked for the last 15 years as a developer, team lead, and solutions architect after studying Business and Information Systems. I spent this time delivering back-end, front-end and full-stack solutions to clients across the spectrum of size and industry.

In most of my roles, I am actively involved in formulating best practices, hiring the right people, and mentoring other developers. I am looking to help organizations adopt the right tools and technologies, level up their development teams, and deliver high-quality solutions.

|Nov 19 - Now
s|Angular Architect
|`Self-employed`

|
2+|I am currently on contract with Briebug Software, a consultancy that connects me with large clients who are working with Angular at scale. I provide these clients with guidance on how to improve or implement state management, CI/CD pipelines, and their code in a monorepo setting. I have also been involved with creating content, such as videos aimed at demystifying tricky concepts like "automation" and "enablement."

s|Angular Architect
|`Nrwl.io`

|
2+|I worked as an Angular Architect at the consultancy behind Nx, which is a very popular framework for managing a monorepo within organizations. I worked with several large clients to level up their development teams and to provide guidance on monorepos, state management, and complex Angular applications. I've used the lessons learned from these clients to publish a book, "Enterprise Angular Monorepo Patterns," available on Gumroad or on Nrwl Connect.

s|Solutions Designer
|`TD Wealth`

|
2+|I acted as an overall Solutions Designer on a large project to allow the bank to offer targeted mortgage rates.
The stack involved a Node.js layer, Java (Spring) to handle communicating with the vendor as well as the mainframe systems, and a UI that allowed agents to provide instant quotes. The team consisted of 11 core members and interfaced with many internal TD systems. I was responsible for overseeing the development efforts, implementing the UI and node.js layer, and specifying interfaces between systems.

s|Application Development Lead
|`Rogers Communications Inc.`

|
2+|I acted as a team lead on two large projects: the Fido dashboard for price plans and the Rogers.com Search and Support pages. I also regularly met with other team leads and architects to go over best practices and guidelines. Additionally, I interviewed candidates. The projects used Angular on the front-end and Java (Spring) with Play and Akka on the back-end.

s|Sr. javascript developer
|`Rangle.io`

2+|As an early senior developer, I led several large projects from inception to delivery. I worked with node.js, Angular, Ionic and nwjs. The projects went through rigorous external security audits and code reviews and have always been at par or above with generally accepted best practices. I mentored 4 colleagues and was involved with developing guidelines, interviewing candidates, discussing our scrum process, evaluating new technologies to adopt, and improvements to ”Rangle Flow.”

s|"Enterprise Angular Monorepo patterns"
|`Nrwl.io`

3+a|This book guides teams using monorepos and the Angular CLI. It contains detailed reasoning and patterns to use with code organization, team interactions (git strategies, versioning, making large-scale changes, and other challenges), and intelligent CI/CD techniques. It features case studies and lessons learned from consulting to large enterprises.

s|Headless CMS-driven Angular application
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|This project was my second experience working with a headless CMS. Some tricky challenges are that we need to query the CMS on page load since it contains both the sitemap definition as well as the page layouts. Further, the CMS returns content as slug IDs and we need to make further calls to fetch the actual content. Using an intermediate server (for API calls as well as server-side rendering) eases some of these pain-points.

s|New architecture for Rogers.com pages
|`Rogers Communications Inc.`

3+a|I led a team between 4 and 10 people through the course of the headless-CMS project, which was to be the foundation for future pages on Rogers.com using a new back-end powered by Endeca. It introduced the following patterns: Redux for application state, node.js and koa for a dev
server, HATEOAS-style interactions, Polymer elements, and using Nashorn
to parse large JSON responses from Endeca. The architecture proved to be
robust enough for future work by simple extension.

s|Mobile application for mechanics
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|Our client required a large mobile application for mechanics to manage their work-day. It featured integration with Google maps, multiple
back-end systems, data synchronization, offline queueing and many complex
business rules. This project featured the ability to automatically update
the HTML, CSS and javascript of the cordova application on the fly without
a need to re-deploy the application. I led a team of 6-8 developers on the
project.

s|Mobile communications tool for mechanics
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|Our client required a large mobile application which allowed mechanics to chat, receive alerts and
track locations. I led a team of 3 developers on this project. (cordova/nwjs
application with isomorphic javascript written using angularjs)

s|Campaign BaaS
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|Our client required a large campaign management tool (BaaS) for an advertising agency that allowed them to create, maintain, and draw insights from their various ad campaigns. The back-end admin interface was very robust and allowed for storage of any type of data while also allowing for constraints on data types and validation rules, which could be specified at run-time. A cluster of node processes communicated to stay in sync. The back-end API was scalable and passed an external security audit on the first round. I led a team of 5 developers on this project. (The back-end was written in node.js with custom clustering, and used Redis and MongoDB. The front-end was written with Jade, Coffeescript and Backbone. The infrastructure used Grunt and browserify)

s|Public transit back-end
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|We built a large back-end to handle all transactions from public transit units, tracking passengers and fares. When buses and trains returned to the depot the custom-built hardware transmitted the trip details to the depot server (as binary), and we parsed this into documents to store in Mongo. The admin UI we built around this was deployed to three medium-sized city transportation systems and was fault-tolerant and highly secure. (This was written in node.js and the back-end admin UI was built with Angular.js. This project featured a very robust authentication and authorization mechanism which was isomorphic between the app and API)

s|Merchandise sales platform
|`Koda Media Group`

3+a|I built a merchandise management PWA that allowed for some very in-depth querying capabilities, e.g. what songs on a tour led to
the most sales on a particular type of product so that inventory could be managed accordingly. (This was built using angularjs and featured an API written
in nodejs. The data was stored in Neo4j)
