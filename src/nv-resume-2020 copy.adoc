## Nitin Vericherla

image::blank.png[,5,5]

I've worked for the last 15 years as a developer, team lead, and solutions architect after studying Business and Information Systems. I spent this time delivering back-end, front-end and full-stack solutions to clients across the spectrum of size and industry.

In most of my roles, I am actively involved in formulating best practices, hiring the right people, and mentoring other developers. I am looking to help organizations adopt the right tools and technologies, level up their development teams, and deliver high-quality solutions.


### What I bring to the table

#### Architecture
I have a long career to draw upon and many experiences that guide my analysis and recommendations. I have worked hands-on with many different front-end  and back-end systems, and in many industries and verticals. I delve deep into the existing technology and provide recommendations that are suited for the organization, with an eye for best practices when they are applicable.

I can help with the following:

  * Implementing large new initiatives
  * Evaluating how teams are developing features and what they can do to be more collaborative
  * Evaluating current processes to see how they can be improved

#### Developer experience
I've worked with companies who focus on building developer tools and have always been interested in leveraging tooling to help reduce monotony and waste in developer time.

I can help with implementing solutions that automate the every day tasks that developers spend time on, and which really add up over the weeks. Every hour that is wasted by watching a spinner or spent manually copy-paste editing repetitive code is time that could be spent on more productive tasks. It also has an impact on overall developer satisfaction.

#### Mentoring and growing teams
I've mentored developers who are subject matter experts and those who are entering the field. I aim to help them with their growth and to provide them with meaningful feedback. I have experience with rolling out feedback systems that continue to be used and which provide full transparency for developers and the organization, and have experience with growing teams with effective hiring and retaining them through effective mentorship.

|Jan 20 - Dec 20
s|Angular Architect
|`SiriusXM (contract)`

|
2+a|
Architecture::
* Incorporated Nx, Cypress, linting rules and schematics to help with making the codebase consistent and to provide meaningful tests that actually catch bugs
* Drove the adoption of trunk-based development in the organization by providing concrete solutions to current concerns: implemented feature-flags, a code deprecation process and code-owners functionality to address concerns over ownership and working on shared code; brought in robust Cypress testing and CI checks to address concerns over quality and defects; demonstrated cherry-picking to isolate release branches; and more.

Developer experience::
* Drove CI implementation to incorporate checks and reviews. Build times were brought down from hours to an optimistic time of around 10 minutes with linting, tests, and builds.
* Drove the provisioning and use of Docker for local development, which reduced the running time of tasks and onboarding for Windows users, and provided a consistent experience across platforms.

Mentoring::
* Provided training and 1:1 for all developers and leads.
* Conducted workshops on Docker, using the CLI scripts, best practices around testing and state management.

s|Angular Architect
|`Nrwl.io`

|
2+a|I worked as an Angular Architect at the consultancy behind Nx, which is a very popular framework for managing a monorepo within organizations. I worked with several large clients to level up their development teams and to provide guidance on monorepos, state management, and complex Angular applications. I've used the lessons learned from these clients to publish a book, "Enterprise Angular Monorepo Patterns," available on Gumroad or on Nrwl Connect.

Architecture::
* Provided guidance to several large clients on moving to trunk-based development in a monorepo: working out ownership structure as well as processes.
* Provided guidance to migrate to a monorepo for several enterprise clients.
* Worked with team leads on addressing their most pressing issues and provided guidance and proofs-of-concept to realizing solutions.

Mentorship and growth initiatives::
* Developed hiring processes for Nrwl (as well as a few clients); with specific coding challenges appropriate for the level of developer being hired. I was responsible for driving the entire hiring process for the organization, and it was an interesting challenge due to the high bar for candidates.
* Mentored 4 Nrwl developers to help them with their professional growth.
* Implemented a version of the 360-feedback system that was successful at Rangle: it proved to be useful for conveying feedback about the company back to the founders, providing concrete feedback to developers from their peers and from the manager, and it helped to surface things that developers were going out of their way to do that would otherwise be invisible to the organization.

s|Solutions Designer
|`TD Wealth (contract)`

|
2+a|I acted as an overall Solutions Designer on a large project to allow the bank to offer *targeted mortgage rates for customers*.

The stack involved a Node.js layer, Java (Spring) to handle communicating with the vendor as well as the mainframe systems, and a UI that allowed agents to provide instant quotes. The team consisted of 11 core members and interfaced with many internal TD systems. I was responsible for overseeing the development efforts, implementing the UI and node.js layer, and specifying interfaces between systems.

Architecture::
* The solution featured many disparate systems that needed to work together: a vendor system, a database, several mainframe systems, a couple of APIs and several front-ends. It also needed a system for manual intervention since the product was business-critical.
* There were many business rules that needed to be captured and implemented, and the vendor solution was not usable at this time; we needed to implement a way to allow a merge between the vendor-recommended values, business rules, and manually set values for specific scenarios.
* This was not a real-time system - it dealt with aggregated data and many batch processes with very large data sets.

s|Sr. javascript developer
|`Rangle.io`

|
2+a|As an early senior developer, I led several large projects from inception to delivery. I worked with node.js, Angular, Ionic and nwjs. The projects went through rigorous external security audits and code reviews and have always been at par or above with generally accepted best practices.

Architecture::
* Led the development of a transit application that collected and aggregated route information from custom transit terminals, and to provide a way to visualize and analyze the data.
* Led the development of a white-label campaign solution for a client, which allowed for custom advertising campaigns that were driven by the same back-end. It went through several rigorous external security audits and passed each time.
* Led the development of a real-time presence and communication desktop/mobile application for a client.
* Led the development of a mobile application to track employee activity in the field.

Mentorship::
I mentored 4 colleagues in their professional growth, and conducted their 360 reviews every quarter.

s|"Enterprise Angular Monorepo patterns"
|`Nrwl.io`

3+a|This book guides teams using monorepos and the Angular CLI. It contains detailed reasoning and patterns to use with code organization, team interactions (git strategies, versioning, making large-scale changes, and other challenges), and intelligent CI/CD techniques. It features case studies and lessons learned from consulting to large enterprises.

s|Headless CMS-driven Angular application
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|This project was my second experience working with a headless CMS. Some tricky challenges are that we need to query the CMS on page load since it contains both the sitemap definition as well as the page layouts. Further, the CMS returns content as slug IDs and we need to make further calls to fetch the actual content. Using an intermediate server (for API calls as well as server-side rendering) eases some of these pain-points.

s|New architecture for Rogers.com pages
|`Rogers Communications Inc.`

3+a|I led a team between 4 and 10 people through the course of the headless-CMS project, which was to be the foundation for future pages on Rogers.com using a new back-end powered by Endeca. It introduced the following patterns: Redux for application state, node.js and koa for a dev
server, HATEOAS-style interactions, Polymer elements, and using Nashorn
to parse large JSON responses from Endeca. The architecture proved to be
robust enough for future work by simple extension.

s|Mobile application for mechanics
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|Our client required a large mobile application for mechanics to manage their work-day. It featured integration with Google maps, multiple
back-end systems, data synchronization, offline queueing and many complex
business rules. This project featured the ability to automatically update
the HTML, CSS and javascript of the cordova application on the fly without
a need to re-deploy the application. I led a team of 6-8 developers on the
project.

s|Campaign BaaS
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|Our client required a large campaign management tool (BaaS) for an advertising agency that allowed them to create, maintain, and draw insights from their various ad campaigns. The back-end admin interface was very robust and allowed for storage of any type of data while also allowing for constraints on data types and validation rules, which could be specified at run-time. A cluster of node processes communicated to stay in sync. The back-end API was scalable and passed an external security audit on the first round. I led a team of 5 developers on this project. (The back-end was written in node.js with custom clustering, and used Redis and MongoDB. The front-end was written with Jade, Coffeescript and Backbone. The infrastructure used Grunt and browserify)

s|Public transit back-end
|`Rangle.io`

3+a|We built a large back-end to handle all transactions from public transit units, tracking passengers and fares. When buses and trains returned to the depot the custom-built hardware transmitted the trip details to the depot server (as binary), and we parsed this into documents to store in Mongo. The admin UI we built around this was deployed to three medium-sized city transportation systems and was fault-tolerant and highly secure. (This was written in node.js and the back-end admin UI was built with Angular.js. This project featured a very robust authentication and authorization mechanism which was isomorphic between the app and API)

s|Merchandise sales platform
|`Koda Media Group`

3+a|I built a merchandise management PWA that allowed for some very in-depth querying capabilities, e.g. what songs on a tour led to
the most sales on a particular type of product so that inventory could be managed accordingly. (This was built using angularjs and featured an API written
in nodejs. The data was stored in Neo4j)
